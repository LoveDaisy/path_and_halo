## Quick start

I use a thirdparty library to deal with EALPix grids, see [acknowledgement](#acknowledgement).
So you must put path of MEALPix to matlab system path in order to use them.

`test_packages.m` makes some basic tests.

`render_halo_image.m` set up a simple configuration for a crystal and sun, and run the calculation. *WARNING* it is **VERY LOW**.

## Acknowledgement

I use a matlab version HEALPix algorithm, called MEALPix. It is forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mealpix/
